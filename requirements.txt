## ⚙️ Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the standard `re` module, which is included in the Python standard library.

The specific requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone or Download:** Save the `password_chacker.py` file to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies (though only the standard library is used, this is good practice):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script:** Run the file using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python password_chacker.py
    ```

4.  **Usage:** The tool will prompt you to enter a password. Type your password and press Enter to see the strength assessment, or type `exit` to quit.
